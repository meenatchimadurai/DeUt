                With the arrival of long,lazy days and light,balmy evenings of the summer months,Rishav
                has decided to give in to the new trend of freckling,or as most would call it,summer fling.<br>
                He's head over heels for this girl named Phoebe, but she is frantically running away, always making sure that she's 
                at a constant distance from him.
                <br> Help Rishav to keep being with his love...
